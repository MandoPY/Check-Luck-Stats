# Check-Luck-Stats

YOUR MUST ADD YOUR WALLET AT LINE 144 BEFORE RUNNING IT

This is a simple python code that checks for the values of:

- Paid
- Balance
- Immature
- Hashrate
- Workers (workers have differents colors "on"=Green and "off"=Red)
- Coin Rank
- USD Price
- 1h, 24h and 7 days % change

There is also a 10 minutes countdown that shows how much time left until the code runs again (time can be adjustable inside the code at Line 145)
